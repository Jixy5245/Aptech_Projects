          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            These Swedish meatballs are a Christmas tradition in our family. We
            frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker.
            Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day!
            Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the
            leftovers.

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
              Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand
              until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat;
              cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer
              onion to a mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black
              pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing
              bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.
            </li>
            <li>
              Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
              Pinch off about 1 ½ tablespoons meat mixture per meatball; form
              into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning
              often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will
              still be pink.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth,
              and cover with foil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40
              minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour
              into drippings until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 ½ cups
              liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened,
              about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and
              black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.
            </li>
