# Aptech_Projects

Hello to whomever is reading this. I'm Simon and this is my Git Repository, I know it doesn't look like much but I'm still new to web dev and coding as a whole so please just give me some time to improve on my skills and update my projects-especially my css skills-I learn coding from a tech school called Aptech located in Abuja,Nigeria but I also use odin project to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I really appreciate them for their informative content and I'm open to any suggestions to improve my code
